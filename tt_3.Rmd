```{r import, echo = F}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(janitor)
library(RCurl)



mort <- read_csv("C:/Users/Bryce/Desktop/Github_Projects/tidytuesday/global_mortality_3")

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
